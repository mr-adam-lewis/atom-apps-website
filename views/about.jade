				h1 About Atom Apps
				p Atom Apps is a partnership founded by Adam Lewis and Thomas Vardy with the aim of developing fun and easy to use apps for mobile devices. We are both students and are creating apps to fund our way through University & College. We currently develop apps individually and release them under the same name, however we do intend on collaborating on apps in the future.

				h3 Adam Lewis - Cofounder & Creator of Gravity Sim 3D
				p Hi there! My name is Adam Lewis and I created Gravity Sim 3D. I am currently studying towards a Masters Degree in Computer Science at The University of Sheffield. In my free time, you can usually find me at my desk coding away or spending time with my lovely fianc√©e. I love making apps and being creative and would definitely be interested in pursuing a career in app development once I complete my degree.
